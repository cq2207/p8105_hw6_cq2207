# Problem 1

Load and clean the data for regression analysis

```{r}

bwt =
  read.csv("./data/birthweight.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(
    babysex = factor(babysex, levels = c(1, 2), labels = c("male", "female")),
    frace = factor(frace, levels = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9), labels = c("white", "black", "asian", "puerto rican", "other", "unknown")),
    malform = factor(malform, levels = c(0, 1), labels = c("absent", "present")),
    mrace = factor(mrace, levels = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9), labels = c("white", "black", "asian", "puerto rican", "other", "unknown")),
    premature = if_else(gaweeks>37, "not premature", "premature")
  )

```

Propose a regression model for birthweight:

```{r}
